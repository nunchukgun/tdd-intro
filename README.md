# TDD Intro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
which is why you'll see a bunch of unnecessary stuff in this repo.

## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to provide developers with a series of basic exercises design to improve
their TDD skills.

To run tests in this repo, use:
`npm test`

## Exercises

The following exercises are intended to be undertaken in the order presented here.

### FizzBuzz

The formal rules of [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) are as follows:

Given an array of integers or integer-like strings, build a new array in which:

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "FizzBuzz"
